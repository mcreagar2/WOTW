									<h3>What is it??</h3>
									<p>Chenin Blanc is a white grape most commonly grown in South Africa, though it is also commonly found in the Loire Valley of France. Though there are regional variations, Chenin blanc has a characteristic acidity, regardless of where it is grown [4]. South African Chenin blanc wines are often characterized by notes of quince, yellow apple, pear, chamomile, and honey. In contrast, Chenin blanc wines produced from grapes grown in the Loire Valley of France have primary flavors of quince, pear, pomelo, ginger, and tarragon.</p>
									<p>Chenin Blanc has also some variation based on where it is grown. Grapes grown in colder areas tend to be used in off-dry styles of the wine, whereas some other regions and winemakers produce a dry wine [3]. It is even possible to find sparkling Chenin Blanc varieties. We want</p>

									<p>We had this wine at a game night with our good friends, and we paired it with tacos. The wines were relatively easy to drink and seemed to go pretty well with our food, though suggested pairing is Asian cuisine [2]. These wines were found at <a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.bin105.com"/>bin 105</a> in Lincoln. Along with finding some excellent wine choices, we were very happy to find such a delightful store. The wines are sustainably produced and the store itself features a wine tasting bar. We also really liked the owner, Steve. Highly recommend bin 105 to anyone interested in a neat little location.</p>

									<h2>Lubanzi</h2>
									<h3>Molly's Rating and Tasting Notes</h3>
									<p>6.0. Relatively strong essence of cantaloupe on the nose. There weren't as many fruity flavors as I was expecting, and it was much more dry than expected. I got a slight taste of pear and yellow apple on the tongue, but these were hints at most. The finish is very dry, and I would go as far as to say that the finish was not very clean. I don't know how often I'd drink this wine, especially if the other Chenin Blanc was available.</p>
									<h3>Ryan's Rating and Tasting Notes</h3>
									<p>6.4.</p>
									<h2>Champalou Vouvray</h2>
									<h3>Molly's Rating and Tasting Notes</h3>
									<p>6.2. This wine was much lighter in color than the other Chenin Blanc. I also couldn't pick up much on the nose, though it does smell slightly sweeter, somehow. There are maybe notes of quince or pear on the tongue, but these were very hard to detect. Some saline-esque notes on the tongue. Also a dry finish. A more pleasant wine to drink than the other Chenin Blanc (for me).</p>
