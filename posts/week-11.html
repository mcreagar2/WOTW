									<h3>What is it?</h3>
									<p>Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo is a rosé wine made from the Montepulciano grape. The word "d'Abruzzo" means that the wine is "from the Abruzzo" region of Italy, and "Cerasuolo" is a word used for rosé wines; the literal translation of cerasuolo is "cherry-red" [2, 3]. This wine is a D.O.C. (<i>Denominazione di origine controllata</i>) wine, which means there are laws governing where it can be grown, its grape varieties, and wine styles [3]. This is also actually the newest D.O.C. wine of the Abruzzo region--  it was established as its own entity (separate from Montepulciano d'Abruzzo) in October 2010 [2].
									The primary flavors of a wine made from Montepulciano grapes are red plum, blackberry, dried thyme, baking spices, and mesquite [1]. For the Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo style in particular, winemakers say that the additional primary flavors include cherry and small red berries [3].</p>
									<p>We had this wine with chili and cinnamon rolls, since we were trying to complement the flavors of baking spices and mesquite in the wine with a smoky and cinnamon flair from the food. The chili and cinnamon roll combination was something neither of us had tried before. The cinnamon roll came from <a style="color: blue;" href="https://m.facebook.com/GratitudeCafeBakery"/>Gratitude Bakery</a> in Lincoln. Our friends go there every week, and though we don't have quite the same track record, everything we've had from the bakery has been super delicious!</p>

									<p>This pick was a little more random than our usual method. We'll often have a couple grapes or wines we want to try on a list and find something off the list. For this wine, we were very intrigued by the aesthetic; the label was fun for us as math people, and we liked the color of the wine as well. Once again, we found this wine at <a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.bin105.com"/>bin 105</a> in Lincoln. While we were there, we decided to try a couple wines on tap that can be purchased by the 1, 3, or 5 oz. pour. Sitting outside and drinking some fun wines on a beautiful spring day in Lincoln was the perfect way to end our week.</p>

									<h3>Molly's Rating and Tasting Notes</h3>
									<p>6.0. This wine has a nose of cherry and plum. The taste is somewhat reminiscent of baking spices. At times, I catch a glimpse of a fruit on the tongue, potentially blackberry or plum? All in all, I'd call this fine but not great by any means.</p>
									<h3>Ryan's Rating and Tasting Notes</h3>
									<p>6.4. On the nose I mostly get plum, cherry, and strawberry. However, these scents aren't very deep and intense, and they leave a little bit to be desired. Beneath the fruity smells, I also get vanilla pudding and gelatin. Upon tasting, there's not a whole lot going on. There is a little bit of plum, red licorice, pepper, and allspice. Every now and then I'll have a sip that is a little smoky, but only just. The mouth feel is very light and leaves the tongue a little dry. The after taste is a little acidic with some hints of alcohol, and it doesn't stay for very long. Overall, not a very exciting wine, but I do see potential and would try another one.</p>
